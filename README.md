# Neural-Style-Transfer-Exploration
#### Neural Style Transfer takes two images and transfer style of one image onto the other. I have named the image on which style is applied as content.jpg and image from which style is taken as style.jpg. I have implemented the Neural-Style algorithm developed by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge on Neural Style Tansfer after being inspired by Sourav Sharma's article- "A Simple Neural Style Transfer" on medium.com.
